As per the instruction i have designed the dummy login page and in the next page i have furnished the details of the list of users using the beeceptor  Rest API.By clicking the 
view button for each users we could be redirect to the next page where i just furnished the details of the user in a table using the Rest API.
For this i just used php,html,css,js for scripting and markup the web application.
I hosted the webapplication in betahost.
